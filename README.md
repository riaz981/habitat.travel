Created a landing page for company Habitat Travel. Text will further be
added when the company has more brands. Currently the product brand it has 
is Alpine Habitat. Apartment Sydney is another brand but at the moment not under Habitat Travel but soon might be. Also creating that site. See the other
repository apartmentsydney.

This project also contains PHPMailer that is used to send email to the company head
if a customer has any queries.
